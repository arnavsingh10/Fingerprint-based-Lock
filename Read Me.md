How It Works
When someone is detected via the IR sensor, the system prompts them to scan a fingerprint or an RFID card.

If the fingerprint matches a stored fingerprint OR the RFID UID matches the allowed UID, access is granted.

A door unlock animation (with a custom icon) is shown on the LCD.

If the verification fails or times out after 10 seconds, access is denied.

The system goes back to waiting for someone.




byte allowedUID[4] = {0x61, 0x1A, 0xAD, 0x10};
